<strong>01) Assume that the class Bird has a static method fly().  If b is a Bird, then to invoke fly, you could do Bird.fly();.</strong>
    <em>True</em> -- static methods cannot be called by a created object, they must be invoked by the class

<strong>02) Interface classes cannot be extended but classes that implement interfaces can be extended</strong>
    <em>False</em>      ** Any class can be extended whether it is an interface, implements an interface, or neither.  The only exception to this is if the class is explicitly modified with the word final in which case it cannot be extended.

<strong>03) Any class can implement an interface, but no classes can implement more than a single interface</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>04) All objects implement Comparable.</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>05) It is not possible to test out any single method or class of a system until the entire system has been developed, and so all testing is postponed until after the implementation phase.</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>06) In black-box testing, the tester should already know something about how the program is implemented so that he/she can more carefully identify what portion(s) of the software may lead to errors</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>07) The versions of an overloaded method are distinguished by the number, type, and order of their parameters.</strong>
    <em>True</em>

<strong>08) During program development, software requirements specify</strong>
    <em>what task the program must perform</em>

<strong>09) Of the various phases in software development, which of the following is usually the lengthiest?</strong>
    <em>Maintenance</em>

<strong>10) The idea of having programmers and developers meet in order to critique a software design or implementation is known as</strong>
    <em>a Walkthrough</em>

<strong>11) Having multiple class methods of the same name where each method has a different number of or type of parameters is known as</strong>
    <em>Method Overloading</em>

<strong>12) Which of the following would not be considered an algorithm</strong>
    <em>Shopping List</em>

<strong>13) In order to create a constant, you would use which of the following Java words?</strong>
    <em>Final</em>

<strong>14) Static methods cannot</strong>
    <em>reference non-static instance data</em>

<strong>15) An object that refers to part of itself within its own methods can use which of the following reserved words to denote this relationship?</strong>
    <em>this</em>

<strong>16) Abstract methods are used when defining</strong>
    <em>interface classes</em>

<strong>17) What type of relationship is dependency?</strong>
    <em>uses</em>

<strong>18) A _____________ method or variable can be invoked through its class name.</strong>
    ex: <code>result = Math.sqrt(25);</code>
    <em>static</em>

<strong>19) A(n) _____________ is a collection of abstract methods and constants.</strong>
    <em>interface</em>

<strong>20) Method ______________ is implementing an abstract method from an abstract parent class or interface.</strong>
    <em>Overriding</em>

<strong>21) </strong>
    <em></em>
