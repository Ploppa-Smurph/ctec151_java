<strong>01) Assume that the class Bird has a static method fly().  If b is a Bird, then to invoke fly, you could do Bird.fly();.</strong>
    <em>True</em> -- static methods cannot be called by a created object, they must be invoked by the class

<strong>02) Interface classes cannot be extended but classes that implement interfaces can be extended</strong>
    <em>True</em>

<strong>03) Any class can implement an interface, but no classes can implement more than a single interface</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>04) All objects implement Comparable.</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>05) It is not possible to test out any single method or class of a system until the entire system has been developed, and so all testing is postponed until after the implementation phase.</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>06) In black-box testing, the tester should already know something about how the program is implemented so that he/she can more carefully identify what portion(s) of the software may lead to errors</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>07) The versions of an overloaded method are distinguished by the number, type, and order of their parameters.</strong>
    <em>True</em>

<strong>08) During program development, software requirements specify</strong>
    <em>what task the program must perform</em>

<strong>09) Of the various phases in software development, which of the following is usually the lengthiest?</strong>
    <em>Maintenance</em>

<strong>10) </strong>
    <em></em>

<strong>11) </strong>

<strong>12) </strong>

<strong>13) </strong>
