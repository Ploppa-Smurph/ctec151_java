<h1>CTEC 151 Java wk03 - Using Classes and Objects</h1>
<pre>
<h2>Creating Objects</h2>

<h2>String Class</h2>
    <strong>String</strong> - 'reference' data type. the RAM points to the correct location of all the data. the variable stores the 'reference address' to the data, not the actual data
    .equals("data to check"); .equalsIgnoreCase("DATA to CheCk");  -- checks string against another string
    .length();                      -- the length of the string
    .charAt(0);                     -- returns the character at a certain location within the string
    .indexOf("h");                  -- returns the index of a given character
    .isEmpty();                     -- returns boolean of True or False depending on if the String is empty or not   
    .upperCase();  .lowerCase();    -- changes string to upperCase or lowerCase
    .trim();                        -- removes extra space before and after characters
    .replace('a', 'o');             -- will change all instances of a character and replaces with another, in this example replaces ALL 'a' with 'o'

<h2>Random and Math Classes</h2>
    <strong>import java.util.Random;</strong>
    .nextInt(<em>origin</em>0, <em>bound</em>9);                 -- between 0 and 9
    
    Math.abs();   -- absolute value
    Math.ceil();  -- ceiling value - highest roundup??
    Math.floor(); -- floor value   - does not round, just shows minimum 

<h2>Formatting Output</h2>


<h2>Enumerated Types</h2>
    enums can be set to contain a certain amount of values

    can be created inside or outside of the class
        - there is a enum that is similar to a class, you can create a new enum class in intelliJ and it will be separated, but accessible through the entire project you are working on

        to use an enum - you use dot notation -- in the class example Mr Turner uses IceCreamFlavors, to get the chocolate flavor you type 'IceCreamFlavors.Chocolate'

<h2>03 - Project "Bad Pizza Party"</h2>
Bad Pizza Party- (no if/else statements)
Create a Pizza Party Planner application that asks the user how many pizzas they want to order.  The application should have a size enum that can either be small, medium or large, and should have some variable in the program pre-set to one of these enum values.  
The pizza joint is really inconsistent, so the application should randomly choose a number from 1 to the amount the user entered for how many pizzas are actually delivered.  The application should then provide a total cost based on the following:

$6 per pizza
Tax is 10%
All toppings are free
The application should then tell the user how many pizzas were actually made, what the pre-selected size of the pizzas is and what the total cost is.  You can use the name() method of your enum to get a string of the selected size.

Better Pizza Party - (for if you're ready to experiment with if/else statements)
Enums are much more useful when we're able to make decisions based on them and use them to store information.  That's not easily done without if/else statements, so if you're eager to work ahead a bit, here's another option for this assignment.  If you do want to look ahead on if/else statements, they are covered in Chapter 5 of the book.  You can also view a short overview here: W3 Schools - Java ConditionsLinks to an external site.

Overview
Create a Pizza Party Planner application that asks the user how many pizzas they want to order and what size the pizzas should be.  The application should randomly choose a single pizza topping (or type) for all pizzas.  The application should then provide a total cost based on the following:

small pizzas are $6
medium pizzas are $10
large pizzas are $14
Tax is 10%
All toppings are free
The application should then tell the user how many pizzas to order, what size the pizzas are, what toppings the pizzas have, and what the total cost will be.

Requirements
You don't have to store individual pizza sizes and toppings, it's understood for this problem that all pizzas will be the same size and have the same topping
Define an enum PizzaSize with values small, medium and large
Request an amount and convert that amount into an int for the pizza amount
Utilize the Random class to choose a random topping
You can do this by mentally assigning each topping a number, and setting the topping based on the randomly generated number
Calculate the total cost by multiplying the amount times the price for the specific size, then add 10% of that total
Print out the necessary details for the user
Hints
You'll need to import Random from java.util
You don't need to convert from strings to enum here, you can just compare strings for the size choice and use that to create the related enum using if/else statements
You can use Integer.parseInt() for integer parsing
