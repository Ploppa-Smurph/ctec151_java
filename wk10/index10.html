<strong>01) The property of an object to take on many different forms is called ______________.</strong>
    <em>polymorphism</em>

<strong>02) Polymorphism can be attained through ________ or ________.</strong>
    <em>Inheritance or Interfaces</em>

<strong>03) Assuming that the Primate class is a parent class of the Lemur class. The following code is an example of __________________ casting.</strong>
    <code>Primate primate = lemur;
        Lemur lemur3 = (Lemur)primate;</code>
    <em>object</em>

<strong>04) The specific implementation for a method of a child class is called method _______________.</strong>
    <em>overriding</em>

<strong>05) If a class have multiple methods by same name but different parameters, it is known as method ______________.</strong>
    <em>overloading</em>

<strong>06) _____________ polymorphism is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than at compile-time.</strong>
    <em>Runtime</em>

<strong>07) _________________ polymorphism is the same as method overloading.</strong>
    <em>compile-time</em>

<strong>08) For a binary search of an array to work correctly, the array must already be __________________.</strong>
    <em>sorted</em>

<strong>09) A linear search is much more efficient than a binary search.</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>10) Polymorphism is achieved by</strong>
    <em>Overriding</em>
