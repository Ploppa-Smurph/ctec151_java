<h1>CTEC 151 Java wk01- 01: Intro & 02: Data and Expressions</h1>
<h2>Lesson 01: Introduction</h2>
    <h3>01:01 - Computer Processing</h3>
        <b>Hardware</b> - physical components of the computer, ex: cpu, case, wiring, keyboard, speakers, disk and memory
            <b>CPU</b>
            <b>I/O devices</b>
            <b>Monitor</b>
        <b>Program</b> - series of instructions that hardware executes sequentially 
        <b>Software</b> - consists of programs and the data used by programs.
        <b>GUI (Graphical User Interface)</b>
        <b>Software Design</b>
        <b>Analog</b>
        <b>Digital</b> - breaks information into discrete pieces and represents those pieces as numbers
            <b>Sample Rate</b> - measurements per second
        <b>Digitize</b> - process of converting analog to digital
        <b>Binary</b> - 0 or 1; a single binary digit is called a <i>bit</i>
            - High signal = represents 1 - voltage of high extreme, +5v (in this example)
            - Low signal = represents 0 - voltage of low extreme, -5v (in this ex.)

        <b>Analog signal</b> = Sine wave - curved
        <b>Digital signal</b> = Square wave - 90-degree angles, squared pattern

        1 bit can represent 2 values, 0 or 1
        2 bits represent 4 values (2^2 = 4)
        3 bits represent 8 values (2^3 = 8)
        4 bits represent 16 values (2^4 = 16)
        5 bits represent 32 values (2^5 = 32) and so forth...
        N bits = 2^N, which results in information doubling each time a bit is added. 
    
    <h3>01 - Summary</h3>
        - A computer system consists of hardware and software that work in concert to help us solve problems. 
        - The CPU reads the program instructions from main memory, executing them one at a time until the program ends. 
        - The operating system provides a user interface and manages computer resources.
        - As far as the user is concerned, the interface is the program.
        - Digital computers store information by breaking it into pieces and representing each piece as a number. 
        - Binary is used to store and move information in a computer because the devices that store and manipulate binary data are inexpensive and reliable.
        - There are exactly 2N permutations of N bits. Therefore, N bits can represent up to 2N unique items. 
        - The core of a computer is made up of main memory, which stores programs and data, and the CPU, which executes program instructions one at a time. 
        - An address is a unique number associated with a memory location.
        - Main memory is volatile, meaning the stored information is maintained only as long as electric power is supplied. 
        - The surface of a CD has both smooth areas and small pits. A pit represents a binary 1 and a smooth area represents a binary 0. 
        - The fetch–decode–execute cycle forms the foundation of computer processing.
        - A network consists of two or more computers connected together so that they can exchange information. 
        - Sharing a communication line creates delays, but it is cost effective and simplifies adding new computers to the network. • A local-area network (LAN) is an effective way to share information and resources throughout an organization. • The Internet is a wide-area network (WAN) that spans the globe.• Every computer connected to the Internet has an IP address that uniquely identifies it.• The World Wide Web is software that makes sharing information across a network easy for humans. 
        • A URL uniquely specifies documents and other information found on the Web for a browser to obtain and display. 
        • This book focuses on the principles of object-oriented programming.
        • Comments do not affect a program’s processing; instead, they serve to facilitate human comprehension. 
        • Inline documentation should provide insight into your code. It should not be ambigu- ous or belabor the obvious. 
        • Java is case sensitive. The uppercase and lowercase versions of a letter are distinct.
        • Identifier names should be descriptive and readable.
        • Appropriate use of white space makes a program easier to read and understand.
        • You should adhere to a set of guidelines that establish the way you format and docu- ment your programs. 
        • All programs must be translated to a particular CPU’s machine language in order to be executed. 
        • High-level languages allow a programmer to ignore the underlying details of machine language. 
        • A Java compiler translates Java source code into Java bytecode, a low-level, architecture- neutral representation of the program. 
        • Many different development environments exist to help you create and modify Java programs. 
        • Syntax rules dictate the form of a program. Semantics dictate the meaning of the pro- gram statements. 
        • The programmer is responsible for the accuracy and reliability of a program.
        • A Java program must be syntactically correct or the compiler will not produce bytecode.
        - Object-oriented programming helps us solve problems, which is the purpose of writing a program. 
        • Program design involves breaking a solution down into manageable pieces.
        • Each object has a state, defined by its attributes, and a set of behaviors, defined by its methods. 
        • A class is a blueprint of an object. Multiple objects can be created from one class definition.
