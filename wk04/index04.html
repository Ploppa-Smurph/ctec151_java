<strong>01) The data or _______________________of an object define its state.</strong>
    <em>attributes</em>
    
<strong>02) The _____________________ or functions of an object define the behavior.</strong>
    <em>methods</em>

<strong>03) The ________________ method returns a character string that represents the object in some way. The programmer gets to determine how to define the toString method of a particular object</strong>
    <em>toString</em>

<strong>04) A constructor is a special type of method that instantiates or creates a new object.</strong>
    <em>True</em>

<strong>05) Global data is declared within a method and can only be used in that method.</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>06) A variable declared at the ___________________  level is instance data.</strong>
    <em>Class</em>

<strong>07) UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams show __________________________ among classes.</strong>
    <em>relationships</em>

<strong>08) __________ or access modifiers define in what scope or context a variable, method, or class can be viewed or seen.</strong>
    <em>visibility</em>

<strong>09) Instance variables should have _________________ visibility which means that they are only accessible from within their own class.</strong>
    <em>private</em>

<strong>10) Variables with __________________ visibility can be referenced anywhere. This is generally not recommended as it violates the principle of encapsulation.</strong>
    <em>public</em>

<strong>11) The relationship between a class and an object is best described as</strong>
    <em>objects are instances of classes</em>

<strong>12) To define a class that will represent a car, which of the following definition is most appropriate?</strong>
    <em>public class Car</em>

<strong>13) If a method does not have a return statement, then</strong>
    <em>it must be a void method</em>

<strong>14) Which of the following reserved words in Java is used to create an instance of a class?</strong>
    <em>new</em>

<strong>15) Having multiple class methods of the same name where each method has a different number of or type of parameters is known as</strong>
    <em>method overloading</em>

<strong>16) Instance data for a Java class</strong>
    <em>may be primitive types or objects</em>

<strong>17) Given the method defined here, which of the following method calls is legal?</strong>
    <code>public void foo(int a, int b)</code>
    <em>foo(0/1, 2*3)</em>

<strong>18) Given the method defined here, which of the following method calls is legal?</strong>
    <code>public void doublefoo(double x)</code>
    <em>doublefoo(0);
        doublefoo(0.555);        
        doublefoo(0.1 + 0.2);
        all provided options are legal</em>

<strong>19) All Java classes must contain a main method which is the first method executed when the Java class is called on.</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>20) Java methods can return more than one item if they are modified with the reserved word continue, as in public continue int foo() {...}</strong>
    <em>False</em>
