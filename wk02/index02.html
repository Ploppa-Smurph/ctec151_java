<h1>CTEC 151 Java wk02 - Lesson 02: Data and Expressions</h1>
<h2>Lesson 02: Data and Expressions</h2>
<h3>02.01 Java Data Types</h3>
<b>Numeric Data Types</b>
    - <b>integer</b> - no decimal places, whole numbers
    - <b>foating point</b> - can represent all real numbers
<b>Non-Numeric Data Types</b>
    - <b>character</b> - can only be 1 char, can be a letter or special character 
    - <b>String</b> - series of characters to make word, phrase
    - <b>boolean</b> - conditional operations, true / false
<h3>Numeric Data</h3>
<b>floating point vs integer</b>
    ex: 7/2 in floating point 3.5; 
        7/2 in floating point 3 and 7%2=1; giving the modulus remainder answer

Follows standard order of operations: 
    1st: ()
    2nd: Exponents
    3rd: *, /, % (modulus / remainder)
    4th: +, -
<h3>02.03 Java Variables</h3>
<b>Numerical</b>
    - <i>int</i> - non floating point whole number

    - <i>double</i> - standard data type
    
    - <i>float</i> - requires an 'f' at the end of the data to confirm it is 'float' data type

<b>Non-Numerical</b>
    - <i>char</i> - ''  -- single quote for char

    - <i>String</i> - "" -- uses double quotes for String, single quotes for char

    - <i>boolean</i> - can be either true or false, no quotes

<b>Working with more than 1 value type in a program</b>
ex: <code>
    int hoursWorked = 41;
    double payRate = 11.75;
    double grossPay = hoursWorked * payRate;

    int adjustedPay = (int) grossPay;

    ***output***
    grossPay = 481.75
    adjustedPay = 481
</code>
the int did not round up, it is truncated (cut off at the decimal) 
** the 'round' function can round up instead of cutting off those decimals

<b>Math Functions</b>
    operators: +, -, *, /, %
    Parenthesis: ()
    other: pow(), sqrt(), ...

ex: <code>
    1.564 * 10^6 for a math problem will convert to Java as:

    double value = 1.564 * Math.pow(10, 6); 
</code>

The above code shows the .pow function of Math being used, you declare the number 1st, then the exponent

<h2>02 - Review</h2>
<strong>01) The word 'println' is a(n)</strong>
    <em>Method</em>

<strong>02) A Java variable is the name of a</strong>
    <em>data value stored in memory that can change its value but cannot change its type during the program's execution</em>

<strong>03) What is the value of z after the following assignment statement is executed? # float z = 10/50</strong>
    <em>0.0</em>

<strong>04) Which of the following situations would require a cast?</strong>
    <em>storing a float in an int</em>

<strong>05) What will be the result of the following assignment statement, given that b = 3 and c = 2? # int a = b * (-c + 2)/2</strong>
    <em>0</em>

<strong>06) Which of the following is true regarding the mod operator, %?</strong>
    <em>It can be performed on any numeric value and it's result is always numeric</em>

<strong>07) Assume that x, y, and z are all integers equal to 105, 20, and 2 respectively. What is the result of: x/y/z</strong>

<h2>02 - Project: Budget</h2>
- Program should ask for and store housing, food and transportation percentages as doubles
- Program should calculate savings percentage as a double
- Program should display what this budget is to the user
- Program should ask for and store income as a double
- Program should display cash amounts based on calculations with the appropriate percentages
- Program should display a "simplified" version using an int and a "more precise" version using the double

** This program does not have to handle errors. It is assumed that the user won't enter bad input or percentages that go outside of 100%

Hints
- You can use a Scanner object to get double values directly with the nextDouble() method
- You can cast values into an int to get the "simplified" version
    -- Note:  Casting to an int does not round figures, but just drops information off, so this isn't a very good use of casting (but at least it makes you try it out)
    --- For an example of why this is, look at the Food Cash output in the example text above
- The savings budget is just 100% minus all the other budgets
- 100% written as a normal number is just 1.0
