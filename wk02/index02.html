    <h3>01 - Review</h3>
    <b>01) Direct addressing is to indirect addressing as (indicate the best match):</b>
        <i>Primitive variable is to reference variable.</i>

    <b>02) This structure is the best model for describing the chapters and sections and subsections of a textbook.</b>
        <i>Tree</i>

    <b>03) A protected variable: </b>
        <i>Is visible inside the class within which it is defined, or within it's package, or within classes derived from it's classes.</i>

    <b>04) In Java, method arguements are passed by:</b>
        <i>Value</i>

    <b>05) This Java statement is used to "anounce" that an exception has occured.</b>
        <i>Throw</i>

    <b>06) Subclasses are assignment compatible with the superclasses above them in the inheritance hierarchy.</b>
        <i>True</i>

    <b>07) A tree child element can only have a single parent.</b>
        <i>True</i>

    <b>08) A private variable cannot be accessed from anywhere.</b>
        <i>False</i>

    <b>09) A queue is a first in, first out structure.</b>
        <i>True</i>

    <b>10) A class definition can be used to create multiple objects.</b>
        <i>True</i>

    <b>11) Structure is best model for a group of customers waiting to check out in a grocery store.</b>
        <i>Queue</i>

    <b>12) Java programmers define their own exceptions by ________________ the libraryâ€™s Exception class.</b>
        <i>Extending</i>

    <b>13) The following code results in garbage being created.</b>
        <code>Circle c1 = new Circle(8);
            Circle c2;
            c2 = c1;
        </code>
        <i>False</i>

    <b>14) Java supports single inheritance only, i.e., a class can only directly inherit from a single superclass.</b>
        <i>True</i>

<h2>02 - Project: Budget</h2>
- Program should ask for and store housing, food and transportation percentages as doubles
- Program should calculate savings percentage as a double
- Program should display what this budget is to the user
- Program should ask for and store income as a double
- Program should display cash amounts based on calculations with the appropriate percentages
- Program should display a "simplified" version using an int and a "more precise" version using the double

** This program does not have to handle errors. It is assumed that the user won't enter bad input or percentages that go outside of 100%

Hints
- You can use a Scanner object to get double values directly with the nextDouble() method
- You can cast values into an int to get the "simplified" version
    -- Note:  Casting to an int does not round figures, but just drops information off, so this isn't a very good use of casting (but at least it makes you try it out)
    --- For an example of why this is, look at the Food Cash output in the example text above
- The savings budget is just 100% minus all the other budgets
- 100% written as a normal number is just 1.0
