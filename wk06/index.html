<h1>CTEC151 Java wk06: More Conditionals and Loops</h1>
<h2>06.01 - More Conditionals and Loops</h2>
<h2>06.02 - </h2>
<h2>06.03 - </h2>
<h2>06.04 - Project: Break Dancin'</h2>
Create a Java program that uses a for loop and a switch statement to narrate some dance steps.  The for loop should iterate from 1 to 10, incrementing by 1 each time.  Inside the for loop, create a switch with cases for 5 of the possible numbers created inside the loop as well as a default action.  For each of those cases, print out a dance move to the console.  For the default case, print out "X claps this time" with X replaced by the number iterated via your for loop.

All of your cases should break except for one, so that one dance move in the sequence is followed by another.

Some example output:

It's dancing time!
The Robot!
2 claps right now.
The Hustle!
4 claps right now.
The Funky Chicken
Break it down!
6 claps right now.
Break it down!
8 claps right now.
And Freeze!
10 claps right now.
Requirements
Create a for loop that iterates from 1 to 10, including 1 and 10
Create a switch inside that for loop that uses the variable defined in the for loop
The switch must contain 5 specific cases matched to different dance moves
One of those cases should allow the next defined dance move to activate before breaking
The switch should have a default case that prints "X claps right now" with X being replaced by the iterating number
The default case is not included in the "5 specific cases" requirement"


<h2>06 - Review</h2>
<strong>01) - A ________________ statement evaluates an expression and attempts to match the result to multiple cases.</strong>
    <em>Switch</em>

<strong>02) - A case statement cannot include non-final variables.

    Try it out in NetBeans if you get stuck.</strong>
    <em>True</em>

<strong>03) - After running the following code:</strong>
    <code>final int a = 3;
        int b = 4;
        switch(a){
            case 3:
                System.out.println("This value is 3"); 
            case 5:
                System.out.println("The value is 5");
            case 7:
                System.out.println("This value is 7");
        }

        The Following will be the output: 'the value is 3'
    </code>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>04) - The

    <code>default</code>

    case is used when there is no other matching case value.</strong>
    <em>True</em>

<strong>05) - The type of a switch statement can only be integer, character, enumerated type, or String</strong>
    <em>True</em>

<strong>06) - What is the output of the following code:</strong>

    <code>int num1 = 4;
    int num2 = 6;
    int larger = ((num1 > num2) ? num1 : num2);
    System.out.println(larger);</code>
    <em>6</em>

<strong>07) - How many times does this loop execute:</strong>

    <code>int count =0;
    
    do{
    
      count++;
    
      System.out.println(count);
    
    } while (count < 5);</code>
    <em>5</em>

<strong>08) - What is wrong with the following code:</strong>

    <code>for(i = 0; i < 4; ++i){
        System.out.println("Hello there");
    }</code>
    <em>The data type of variable i is never declared</em>

<strong>09) - All for loops can be re-written as a while-loop.</strong>
    <em>True</em>

<strong>10) - How many times is the print statement executed in this code:</strong>

    <code>for(int i =0; i < 100; i++){
      for(int j = 1; j <=200; j++){
        System.out.println("Hello");
      }
    }</code>
    <em>20,000</em>

<strong>11) - A continue statement</strong>
    <em>may be used within any Java loop statement</em>

<strong>12) - How can the following statement be rewritten using a conditional operator?</strong>

   <code>if(x <0) y = x;
    else y = 0; </code>
    <em>y = (x < 0) ? x : 0;</em>

<strong>13) - Given the following code, where x = 0, what is the resulting value of x after the for loop terminates?</strong>
    <code>for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        x += i;</code>
    <em>10</em>

<strong>14) - The do loop differs from the while loop in that</strong>
    <em>the do loop will always execute the body of the loop at least once</em>

<strong>15) - the do loop will always execute the body of the loop at least once</strong>
        <code>for(int j = s.length(); j > 0; j--)
            System.out.print(s.charAt(j-1);</code>
    <em>it prints s out backwards</em>

<strong>16) - What does the break statement do?</strong>
    <em>It transfers control out of the current control structure such as a loop or switch statement</em>

<strong>17) - A switch statement must have a default clause</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>18) - Each switch statement must terminate with a break statement</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>19) - Control in a switch statement jumps to the first matching case</strong>
    <em>True</em>

<strong>20) - A for statement is normally used when you do not know how many times the loop should be executed</strong>
    <em>False</em>
